Brainfuck
(1) Direct Interpreter

Implementation of brainfuck in direct interpretation method,
In which scripts are executed in their native language, and
not converted to any intermediate representation!
For e.g. Lisp, Scheme, etc!


Brainfuck
(2) Bytecode Interpreter

Implementation of brainfuck in which scripts are converted
to an intermediate language-representation and then executed
by dedicated VM(Virtual Machine)!


I'm implementating interpreter of language Brainfuck
in two distinct ways, for learning purposes!
And also b'cuz Brainfuck is easy to implement!
