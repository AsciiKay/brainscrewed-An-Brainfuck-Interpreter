# brainscrewed-An-Brainfuck-Interpreter
A simple Brainfuck interpreter implemented in two different ways.  <br/>

<strong>Implementation </strong>  <br/>
(1) Direct Interpreter  <i>(/master/first-hand-interpretation)</i>   <br/>
(2) Bytecode Interpreter  <i>(dev in progress)</i>              <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>(1) Direct Interpretation  </strong>   <br/>
Implementation of brainfuck in direct interpretation method, In which scripts are executed   <br/>
with their native language, and not converted to any intermediate representation!  <br/>
For e.g. Lisp, Scheme, etc!   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>(2) Bytecode Interpretation   </strong><br/>
Implementation of brainfuck in which scripts are converted    <br/>
to an intermediate language-representation and then executed    <br/>
by dedicated VM(Virtual Machine)!     <br/>
<br/>
<i>I'm implementating interpreter of language Brainfuck    <br/>
in two distinct ways, for learning purposes!    <br/>
And also b'cuz Brainfuck is easy to implement!     </i><br/>
<br/>
I'd Love to hear <b>edits, suggestions, and your   <br/>
contribution</b>.  <br/>
