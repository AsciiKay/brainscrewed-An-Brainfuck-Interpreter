<b>Brainfuck Interpreter</b> <br/>


<b>Intro:</b>  <br/>
Brainfuck has 8 instructions, which are turing complete which basically means that   <br/>
they can read-write-manipulate Long array(tape) of memory according to instructions   <br/>
PLUS PLUS bf interpreter does not have any statements, clearly it's a plain turing language.   <br/>
and my array is sort of infinite to the right(Turing Complete).   <br/>

<b>Lil Extra:   </b>    <br/>
The interpreter uses direct instruction interpretation to execute the instructions    <br/>
due to their simplicity,    <br/>
<br/>
The memory consists of infinite memory cells(or as much as python's lists can handle)   <br/>
each cell can store upto 1byte of memory (But I've added unsigned +255 to -255 as byte 
storage in memory cells)    <br/>
